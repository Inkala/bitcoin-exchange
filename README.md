## About this test

To see this test working, clone the repository, type `npm install` from the root folder and then type `npm start`.

### The test

The app has only one view that renders a header with the price for EUR, USD and BTC, the form where the user enters the amount and currency to be converted and the conversion results that appear when the calculation is done.

### Technologies used

For this test I chose to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for it is the one suggested by the test, but also because I had never used Toolkit before.

For the the animations I used [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) for it simplicity and because it is also another technology I am currently trying to learn.

### Success

All the functionalities that were added to the app are working as expected.

### Challenges

Grasping the concept of [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) was really challenging and it took a lot of time, but once it was set up, it was much easier to uses

### What to improve

There is always a lot to do and improve when you are developing something. For example if I had more time I would have added tests with [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) for the UI and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://www.chaijs.com/)/[Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for the functionality, but it is also something that I don't have much experience with and it would take much more time.

I would do better error handling if the APIs fail or if the user enters a wrong input or negative numbers.

I would also improve the view and styles a lot, but I don't think it was the idea of this assignment.
